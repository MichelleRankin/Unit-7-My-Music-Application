# Unit-7-My-Music-Application

## My Unit 7 project is an application 

## I am making a music app which is used to play music

### It can:
- play music
- skip
- replay
- be used on the phone

## Why am I making it?
- I wanted to create a useful application which could be used on the phone as well as on the computer which use downloaded files to find the song you want to listen to. 
- I don't know of any previous projects people at Base Camp have done that have anything to do with what I am creating, so I wanted to do this project even more.
