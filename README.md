# Unit-7-My-Music-Application

## My Unit 7 project is an application 

## I am making a music app which is used to play music

### It can:
- play music
- find new music
- shuffle playlist
- skip
- replay
- add to a playlist 
- be used on the phone

## Why am I making it?
- I wanted to create a useful application which could be used on the phone as well as on the computer which could use youtube and use downloaded files to find the song you want to listen to. 
- I don't know of any previous projects people at Base Camp have done that have anything to do with what I am creating, so I wanted to do this project even more.

## Daily Goals:
### Monday:
- Set up the repository
- Configure the application on the computer

### Tuesday:
- Create the functionality
- As well as start visuals

### Wednesday:
- Accomplish the linking of Youtube 
- Obtain readable music files
- Play Music

### Thursday:
- Debug most of the project
- Finish up on colors and css
- Finish up anything that I'm not finished on

### Friday;
- Finish up final touches
- Present and Kill it
